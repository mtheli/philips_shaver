# ESP Bridge Changelog

## v1.6.2 — 2026-04-22

- Include `uptime_s` in `heartbeat` and `ready` events (previously only
  in `info`). Enables HA to detect bridge restarts via uptime
  regression and clear stale subscription state, so auto-resubscribe
  triggers when the API reconnects after an ESP reboot — even without
  HA actively requesting `ble_get_info`.

## v1.6.1 — 2026-04-17

- Stale-bond detection tuning: `RAPID_DISCONNECT_THRESHOLD_MS` raised
  from 5s to 10s. Service discovery on the XP9201 takes ~5.5s, so a
  disconnect right after re-encrypt (observed at ~5.7s) was missing the
  previous 5s window and the 3-fail auto-clear never triggered. 10s
  covers it with margin. Disconnect log now includes connect duration
  and reason code to make rapid-disconnect traces easier to read.

## v1.6.0 — 2026-04-17

- Fire `ready` status event from `AUTH_CMPL_EVT` (on success) instead of
  `SEARCH_CMPL_EVT`. Some shaver models expose a larger GATT table after
  bonding; reading before encryption completes caused "not found" errors
  for characteristics that only appear in the post-auth cache (observed
  with S7887 / Firmware Revision 0x2A26).
- Heartbeat-based `ready` re-fire is gated on `auth_completed_` for the
  same reason.
- `auth_completed_` is reset on disconnect as a safety.
- Subscribe guard: reject `on_subscribe` calls for characteristics that
  advertise neither `NOTIFY` nor `INDICATE`. Previously the CCCD write
  would fail silently and no data would ever arrive.
- Indicate support: CCCD value is now chosen from the characteristic
  properties (0x0001 notify, 0x0002 indicate, 0x0003 both) instead of
  always writing 0x0001. Notify log line distinguishes Notify vs
  Indicate events.

## v1.5.2 — 2026-04-12

- Fix BLE auth failure after reboot on ESP32-S3. The stricter BLE 5.0
  stack rejected `SEC_ENCRYPT_MITM` on bonds that had originally been
  created via Just Works (e.g. OneBlade QP4530). The bridge now checks
  the stored bond list and uses `SEC_ENCRYPT` for known bonds,
  reserving `SEC_ENCRYPT_MITM` for fresh pairings.

## v1.5.1 — 2026-04-07

- Rename `device_id` to `bridge_id` in config and heartbeat/info events
  to align with the multi-device setup model. Backwards-compatible
  YAML: both keys are accepted.

## v1.5.0 — 2026-03-18

- Move BLE encryption params from YAML to C++ so pairing is driven by
  the component itself.
- Fix CCCD handle discovery to use the ESP-IDF API directly
  (`esp_ble_gattc_get_descr_by_char_handle`) instead of ESPHome's
  descriptor cache, which could be empty after service discovery.

## v1.4.0 — 2026-03-10

- Fire error events from `on_read_characteristic` when a read fails or
  the characteristic is not found (`not_found`, `not_connected`,
  `gatt_err_*`). HA can now resolve the pending read immediately
  instead of waiting for the timeout.

## v1.3.1 — 2026-03-09

- Auto-clear stale BLE bond after OTA or re-flash. Detects rapid
  disconnects without successful auth and removes the bond so the next
  connection starts fresh pairing.

## v1.3.0 — 2026-03-09

- Heartbeat-based `ready` re-fire when BLE is connected but no
  subscriptions are active (e.g. after OTA reboot, when the initial
  ready event is lost before the HA API stream is up). Self-terminates
  once any subscription is registered.

## v1.2.0 — 2026-03-08

- Re-apply SMP params right before pairing (in `GATTC_OPEN_EVT`) so
  Numeric Comparison is advertised correctly on reconnect.
- Auto-confirm Numeric Comparison requests in the GAP event handler so
  pairing works unattended on models that report DisplayYesNo.

## v1.1.0 — 2026-03-08

- Initial ESP32 Bridge release.
- BLE client for Philips shavers (S7000/S8000/S9000/XP9000 series) and
  OneBlade groomers (QP4000).
- Read, write, subscribe/unsubscribe via ESPHome service calls.
- Status events: `connected`, `ready`, `disconnected`, `heartbeat`,
  `auth_failed`.
- `connected` binary sensor for device presence.
- `ble_get_info` diagnostic service for runtime stats.
- Component version reporting in heartbeat and ready events.
